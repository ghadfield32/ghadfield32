# üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Geoff Hadfield (@ghadfield32)

## About Me
I'm a passionate data scientist in training, with a deep love for sports, machine learning, and AI. My mission is to blend my expertise in data science with my passion for sports to push the boundaries of sports analytics. Whether it's basketball, football, or baseball, I'm committed to discovering new insights that can drive performance and strategy at the highest levels of competition.

## üëÄ Interests
- **Sports Deep Learning (Bayesian Methods)**: Exploring the intersection of data science and sports to uncover hidden patterns and enhance decision-making. Bayesian Methods tackle what point estimate models can't, giving interval to help with the uncertainty, invidiualized curves that are lended weights via partial pooling so people with low volume aren't estimated incorrectly. 
- **Machine Learning & AI**: Continuously learning and experimenting with cutting-edge techniques in ML and AI to build smarter models.
- **Technology**: Enthusiastic about leveraging the latest technologies, from Python and R to cloud computing and big data platforms.


## üíº Professional Experience
